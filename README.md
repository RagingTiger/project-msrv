## tl;dr
Example of a `Digital Download` platform/business model using `Flask` in
`Python 3`, `Docker`, and plenty of `Cryptographic` goodness.

## Introduction
The repository depicts an example of how a `Digital Download` platform might be
constructed using `Flask`, `Python 3`, `Docker`, and `Cryptography`, with an
eye towards a `stateless` design. The example chosen for the website, is a
fictitious group of *recording artists* and *musicians* known as `Project MSRV`
(or simply `MSRV` as the fans call them.)
